CONTROL FIELD LOGICAL STRUCTURE

TAG: 3 numeric digits
    (no indicators)
    (no field codes)
    just a sequence of characters that represent data items whose 
    interpretation is field-specific


005 is 16 CHAR
005     19940223151047.0
[February 23, 1994, 3:10:47 P.M. (15:10:47)]

006 is 18 CHAR


007   oh you hateful motherfuckers.
        it's a sequence of mostly single-digit codes
        appears to define up to 23 character positions


VARIABLE DATA FIELD LOGICAL STRUCTURE

TAG: 3 numeric digits
    (meaning specific to field defn):
    first indicator             -single character
    second indicator            -single character

    SUBFIELD
    sequence of subfield codes -- or... maybe not a sequence? can be an unordered collection? Hope so 'cause otherwise that blows goats.
        each field is:
            a "$" leading demarc
            a single ASCII character whose meaning is field-dependent
            zero or more bytes of data, can be UTF-8 or whatevs (what's valid?)

A VARIABLE FIELD CAN OCCUR MULTIPLE TIMES FOR DIFFERENT PURPOSES... ???
